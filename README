Apple Summer Internship Resume
Jonathan Hirz

This is an app I created to apply for a summer internship and developer job at Apple.
It has been useful as a resume, and will be updated as I work on more projects.

Feel free to use any code/images you like. A link back to this project would be appreciated.
